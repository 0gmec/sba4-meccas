Reflection
Working on this project, the biggest challenge I ran into was debugging and getting the task filtering to work properly. 
It was frustrating at times, especially when I spent over four hours trying to fix one issue with filtering by status. 
I ended up figuring it out through a lot of trial and error, checking the console constantly, and slowly narrowing down where the problem was happening.

I used a ton of online resources to help me mostly MDN and W3Schools, but I also checked Eloquent JavaScript for a better understanding of certain topics. 
Reading through documentation and experimenting helped me push through most of the problems.

If I had more time, I would’ve worked on improving how tasks are saved using localStorage since I didn’t fully get to implement it. 
I’d also try to clean up and shorten my code, because I realized I tend to write things in a beginner style repeating logic or making things more complicated than they need to be. 
Lastly, I’d spend time on improving the UI to make it look cleaner and easier to use.
